# Amazon Review Analysis




## Introduction

The Amazon Review Dataset presented here comprises 1,465 product reviews, offering rich insights into customer opinions, product details, and pricing trends on the platform. This dataset spans 16 key attributes, including product metadata, user-generated content, and review-specific features.

Each entry includes essential fields such as:

Product details `(product_id, product_name, category, actual_price, discounted_price, discount_percentage)`

Customer reviews and sentiments `(rating, rating_count, review_title, review_content)`

User metadata `(user_id, user_name, review_id)`

Additional fields like `about_product`, `img_link`, and `product_link` that provide further context for each listing.

The data provides an excellent opportunity for exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, pricing pattern detection, and the evaluation of customer satisfaction levels across different product categories. By combining text analytics with structured data, we can derive meaningful insights into consumer behavior and product performance on Amazon.
